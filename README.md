# Holidaze â€“ Venue Booking Web App

This is my Project Exam 2 submission. 
Holidaze is a modern, tropical-themed booking platform where users can search for, view, and book holiday venues. Venue Managers can register, create their own listings, and monitor upcoming bookings. This app was built using React and Tailwind CSS and integrates fully with Noroff's Holidaze API (v2).

This website uses API: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/holidaze/venues
